# Facial Emotion Detection ðŸ¤–

This project uses a CNN trained on the FER2013 dataset to detect facial expressions in real-time using a webcam.

## Features
- Trained with ~29,000 images from FER2013
- Real-time detection with OpenCV
- Achieves ~58% test accuracy

## How to Use
1. Train the model using `train_model_colab.ipynb` (Google Colab)
2. Run `webcam_emotion_detector.py` locally to detect emotions live
